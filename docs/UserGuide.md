<h1 style="color:#e16a1f;">LockedIn User Guide</h1>

LockedIn is a desktop app for **Computer Science undergraduates applying for internships**. It helps you keep track of applications, roles, links, statuses, and notes in one place.

LockedIn is optimized for users who prefer typing commands. If you are comfortable with keyboard-driven workflows, LockedIn helps you manage applications faster while reducing context switching between job portals, spreadsheets, and email threads.

Notes about the command format
</h3>

<box type="info" seamless>

**How to read command formats**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are values to be supplied by the user.
  Example: in `add c/COMPANY`, `COMPANY` can be used as `Google`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
  Example: `c/COMPANY [u/URL]` can be used as `c/Google u/https://careers.google.com` or as `c/Google`.

* Parameters can be entered in any order unless stated otherwise.
  Example: if the command specifies `c/COMPANY r/ROLE`, `r/ROLE c/COMPANY` is also accepted.

* **Commands that ignore extra arguments:** `help`, `list`, `exit` treat extra words as insignificant.
  Example: `help 123` is treated as `help`.

* **Strict commands that reject extra arguments:** `clear`, `drop` will show an error if any arguments are provided.
  Example: `clear 4` will show an error message.

* Leading and trailing spaces around field values are ignored.
  Example: `add c/  Google   r/  Software Engineer  ` is treated the same as `add c/Google r/Software Engineer`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying commands that wrap across multiple lines. Spaces around line breaks may be omitted when pasted into the app.

</box>

<a id="supported-characters"></a>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Valid characters for company, role, and note**

LockedIn accepts:

* English letters (`A-Z`, `a-z`)
* digits (`0-9`)
* spaces
* these symbols:
  `` ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) - _ = + [ { ] } \ | ; : ' " , < . > / ? ``

Characters outside this set are rejected.

</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**About non-ASCII characters and decorative fonts**

LockedIn currently validates company names, role names, and notes using a fixed ASCII-only character set. This means non-ASCII characters from non-Latin scripts, decorative fonts, emojis, and many non-English characters may be rejected or behave differently from normal English text.

For best results, use standard English letters, digits, spaces, and the supported symbols listed above.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:**
You can press the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys in the command box to browse previously entered commands in the current session.

<a id="find"></a>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.3em; color: #d9730d; margin-top: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 0.4em;">
Find applications: <code>find</code>
</h3>

Finds applications whose company names, roles, application dates, URLs, or statuses match the given filters.
For date fields, it can either find exact dates or find dates within a range (inclusive).

| Before                               | After                              |

**Format:** `find [c/COMPANY] [r/ROLE] [d/DATE_OR_DATE_RANGE] [u/URL] [s/STATUS]`

**Date formats supported**

* Exact date: `d/2025-03-14`
* Date range: `d/2025-03-01:2025-03-31`

**Notes**

* You must provide at least one field.
* You cannot provide an empty parameter. A prefix must be followed by at least one keyword (e.g. `find c/` is invalid).
* The search is case-insensitive.
  Example: `c/google` matches `Google`.
* Status keywords are also case-insensitive. For example, `find s/applied` and `find s/APPLIED` are both valid.
* For company, role, URL, and status, applications matching at least one keyword in the same field are returned.
* For URL fields, the keyword must match exactly as stored, including characters such as trailing slashes (`/`). For example, `https://www.example.com` does not match `https://www.example.com/`. This exact-match behavior is by design to ensure precise URL identification in the application database.
* If multiple fields are specified, applications must match all those fields.
* `d/START_DATE:END_DATE` returns applications whose application dates fall within the range, inclusive.
* `START_DATE` must be earlier than or equal to `END_DATE`.
* All dates must be valid and must follow the format `yyyy-MM-dd`.

**Examples**

* `find c/Google`
* `find r/Intern`
* `find c/Google r/Intern`
* `find u/https://www.google.com/`
* `find s/Applied`
* `find d/2025-03-14`
* `find d/2025-03-01:2025-03-31`
* `find c/TikTok d/2025-02-01:2025-02-28 s/Interview`

**What you should expect**

* The application list updates to show only matching entries.
* The success message shows the number of applications found and hints you can use `list` to restore the full list.

## <span style="color:#4a90e2;">FAQ</span>

<br>

**Q: Can I use emoji or non-English characters in company, role, or note fields?**<br>
A: No. LockedIn currently supports only English letters, digits, spaces, and a [fixed set of symbols](#supported-characters) for those fields.

<br>

**Q: Why do certain characters not work properly?**<br>
A: LockedIn validates the company, role, and note fields using an ASCII-only character set. Non-ASCII characters (including those from non-Latin scripts and decorative fonts) may be rejected. Only the [supported character set](#supported-characters) is reliably accepted.

**Q: What date format should I use?**<br>
A: Use the format `yyyy-MM-dd`. For example, `2025-02-14`.

<br>

**Q: What does `INDEX` mean?**<br>
A: `INDEX` is the number shown next to an application in the current displayed list. Use it for commands such as `edit`, `delete`, `next`, `copy`, `note`, and `clearnote`.

<br>

**Q: Why does my command not work?**<br>
A: Check the command format carefully. Common mistakes include:

* using [unsupported characters](#supported-characters)
* exceeding the character limit
* using the wrong date format
* entering an invalid index
* forgetting a required prefix such as `c/` or `r/`
* omitting required fields

<br>

**Q: Why can’t I copy a URL?**<br>
A: The selected application may not have a URL saved. Add one first using `edit INDEX u/URL`.

<br>

**Q: How do I return to the full application list after using `find`?**<br>
A: Use the `list` command.

<br>

**Q: What statuses can an application have?**<br>
A: LockedIn currently uses these statuses: `Applied`, `OA`, `Interview`, `Offered`, `Rejected`, and `Withdrawn`.

<br>

**Q: What makes two applications duplicates?**<br>
A: Two applications are duplicates if they have the same company, role, and application date. URL, status, and note do not affect duplicate detection.

<br>

**Q: What is the difference between `delete`, `clear`, and `drop`?**<br>
A:

* `delete INDEX` removes one application.
* `clear` removes all applications in the current displayed list.
* `drop` removes only displayed applications with `Rejected` or `Withdrawn` status.

<br>

**Q: How do I move my data to another computer?**<br>
A: Install LockedIn on the other computer and replace the empty data file it creates with the data file from your current LockedIn home folder.

## <span style="color:#4a90e2;">Known Issues</span>

<br>

##### 1. Application opens off-screen after switching displays

**Problem:**
When using multiple screens, the application window may be placed on a secondary screen. If you later switch back to using only the primary screen, the GUI may open off-screen.

**Solution:**
Delete the `preferences.json` file before starting the application again.

##### 2. Help window does not appear after being minimized

**Problem:**
If the Help window is minimized and you run `help` again:

* the existing Help window may stay minimized
* no new Help window may be shown

**Solution:**
Manually restore the minimized Help window.
